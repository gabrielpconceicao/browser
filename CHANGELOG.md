# Upcoming

## 0.1.0

**first usable version**
Inspite this is a working version, does't mean that requirehit is already on
its usable state. This package was published just for giving me ability to
continue development on [requirehit](https://github.com/requirehit/requirehit) repo.

- Added CHANDELOG.md
- Added TODO.md
- Updated README.md
- Extendable building system
- `process` building plus bindings and native emulation
- `global` variable system which allows `scope` creation, that allows us a way
of sandbox context creation for each module, which is AWESOME for detecting
variable leaking and sort of.

## 0.0.1

Published for name allocation proposes on `npmjs`.
