requirehit-browser
==================

**browser-side requirehit engine**

This repo contains cross-browser code to: setup, download, decode and require
**requirehit** packages.

## Building dist file

```bash

  $ npm run dist-build

```

This will create `dist/output.js` which should be used by `requirehit` to create
an initial bundle file.

## Cleaning dist

```bash

  $ npm run dist-clean

```
