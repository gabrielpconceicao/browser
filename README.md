requirehit-browser
==================

**browser-side requirehit engine**

**requirehit engine** uses lots of source code available on **nodejs**, in fact,
it's almost like a cross-browser compatible fork of **nodejs**.

This repo contains code to: setup, download, decode and require **requirehit**
packages.

## Building dist file

```bash

  $ npm run dist-build

```

This will allow a build with extendable options which should be used by
`requirehit` package to create its initial bundle file.

## Cleaning dist

```bash

  $ npm run dist-clean

```
